# 🏦 Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Tool Used:** Power BI (DAX, Power Query)  
**Dataset:** 38,576 loan records | 24 fields  
**Domain:** Banking & Financial Services  

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio using Power BI. The goal was to build an interactive, multi-page dashboard that gives the bank a consolidated view of its lending operations, tracking loan performance, identifying risky segments and enabling data-driven decisions around credit risk management.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Objectives

The bank needed a centralized reporting solution to monitor the health of its loan portfolio across thousands of records. Key business questions this analysis answers:

- What percentage of loans are performing (Good) vs defaulting (Bad)?
- How do lending volumes and funded amounts trend month over month?
- Which states, loan purposes and borrower profiles carry the highest risk?
- How do metrics like interest rate and DTI vary across loan grades?

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Converted date columns to proper Date format
- Removed inconsistent and null records
- Standardized categorical fields like loan status, grade and purpose
- Built a custom **Date Table** using DAX `CALENDAR()` function for time intelligence

### 2. Data Modelling
- Established relationships between fact table and date dimension table
- Marked Date Table as official date table in the model
- Clean star schema for efficient DAX calculations

### 3. DAX Measures Built
- `Total Loan Applications` → `COUNT(loan_id)`
- `Total Funded Amount` → `SUM(loan_amount)`
- `Total Amount Received` → `SUM(total_payment)`
- `Average Interest Rate` → `AVERAGE(int_rate)`
- `Average DTI` → `AVERAGE(dti)`
- `MTD Metrics` → `TOTALMTD()` time intelligence function
- `MoM Metrics` → `CALCULATE()` with `DATEADD()` for previous month comparison
- `Good Loan %` → `CALCULATE(COUNT(id), loan_status IN {"Fully Paid","Current"}) / COUNT(id)`
- `Bad Loan %` → `CALCULATE(COUNT(id), loan_status = "Charged Off") / COUNT(id)`

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Portfolio is healthy** — 86.2% good loans. Grade D–G loans carry the highest default risk and need tighter monitoring.
- **Debt consolidation dominates** at 47.2% of all applications, opportunity to develop specialized products for this segment.
- **California accounts for 17.9%** of all loans — geographic concentration risk worth monitoring.
- **Loan volumes peak in December** — operational capacity should be planned accordingly for Q4.
- **Total received ($473M) exceeds total funded ($435M)** — the $38M difference represents interest income earned by the bank.
